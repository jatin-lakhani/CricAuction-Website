               <p> Ayush Mhatre and Shaik Rasheed might be new names in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) squad, 
                but their stories are anything but typical. Both players took very different roads to the 
                IPL — one from the outskirts of Mumbai, the other from Andhra Pradesh’s cricketing circuits.</p>
                <p>What connects them isn’t just a jersey. It’s family.
                </p>
                <p>Their dreams weren’t self-made — they were built on relentless sacrifices, early alarms, packed trains, and unshaken belief.
